# What is this?

* Is an API wrapper over [starrailstation](https://starrailstation.com) and others like Hoylab.
* Python library is still work in progress, contributions are welcome.

# Raw Data and Images

If you're just looking for raw data (json) for characters, lightcones etc.,  images , check [data](https://github.com/reko-beep/hsr-data/tree/data) branch of this repo.

Alternatively, see ```raw_data.py``` to generate it yourself, it gets all data from [starrailstation](https://starrailstation.com/) and saves it in json format.

WARN: simulatedUniverse data might throw errors as date calculation is not month safe, it might throw date not exists in month type errors.
